# Jerry-s_Croissants

This was my very first project I've built from stratch. I used python with the library pygame. I built this over 3 years ago and have learned a lot since then. I know the code isn't the cleanest but I've decided to leave the code as it was originally written and post it on github just so that I can look at the project in the future.

P.S. I think I tried making the game run as an executable which explains why I have folders like 'build' and 'dist' and just a bunch of code that I didn't add myself. If you want to try it out just execute main.py.
