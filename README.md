# Jerry-s_Croissants

This was my very first project I've built from stratch. I used python with the library pygame. I built this over 3 years ago and have learned a lot since then. I know the code isn't the cleanest but I've decided to leave the code as it was originally written and post it on github just so that I can look at the project in the future.

UPDATE:
Original project was moved to another branch. Will push updates to this project every once in a while. Just for fun.
